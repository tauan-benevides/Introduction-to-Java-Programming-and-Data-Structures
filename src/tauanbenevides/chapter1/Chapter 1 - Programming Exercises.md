![alt text](../chapter1/images/1.7.1.png) and ![alt text](../chapter1/images/1.7.2.png)

Use 1.0 instead of 1 in your program.

## 1.10 (Average speed in miles) Assume that a runner runs 14 kilometers in 45 minutes and 30 seconds. Write a program that displays the average speed in miles per hour. (Note 1 mile is equal to 1.6 kilometers.)

---

## *1.11 (Population projection) The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the following assumptions:
 
- One birth every 7 seconds
- One death every 13 seconds
- One new immigrant every 45 seconds

Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume that the current population is 312,032,486, and one year has 365 days. 
Hint: In Java, if two integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fractional part is truncated. 
For example, 5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25) and 10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5). 

To get an accurate result with the fractional part, one of the values involved in the division must be a number with a decimal point. 
For example, 5.0 / 4 is 1.25 and 10 / 4.0 is 2.5.

---

## 1.12 (Average speed in kilometers) Assume that a runner runs 24 miles in 1 hour, 40 minutes, and 35 seconds. Write a program that displays the average speed in kilometers per hour. (Note 1 mile is equal to 1.6 kilometers.)

---

## *1.13 (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramer’s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation provided that ad – bc is not 0:

Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y: 
(Hint: replace the symbols in the formula with numbers to compute x and y. This exercise can be done in Chapter 1 without using materials in later chapters.)
